This User_guide will guide you step by step to help you complete the inversion based on the mini-LOMOS sensors, depending on how you chose to use it. 
Please refer to "LOMOS-mini: A coupled system quantifying transient water and heat exchanges in streambeds" from Cucchi et al. (2017) if you want to know more about it.

Prelude :

Before making anything, please make sure you've installed the "dos2unix" UNIX package. You can do it from the terminal :
> apt install dos2unix

Also, make sure that all the files of the "mini-LOMOS" file are executable :
> chmod 775 *

In order to make the R scripts work, you'll also need the packages "lubridate", "hydroGOF" and "stringr".
You can respectively install them on R with the following command lines :
install.packages(lubridate)
install.packages(hydroGOF)
install.packages(stringr)
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1) Add field data. There must be 2 ".csv" files (one for pressure and one for temeratures) with the following format: sensor-name_point_dd_MM_YY.csv
 
Particularly pay attention of the dates formatting in the titles, this could explain why the 1D model doesn't work.
-------------------------------------
example (respectively for temperature and pressure) :
t502_Point1_07_11_14.csv
p502_Point1_07_11_14.csv

The format of the pressure differential file is :
#,dates,pressure_differential [m],temperature in stream [C],
1,04/11/2014 17:00:00,1.184,11.516,
etc.

The format of the temperature file is :
#,dates,temperature depth 1 [C],temperature depth 2 [C],temperature depth 3 [C],temperature depth 4 [C],
1,04/11/2014 17:00:00,12.775,12.92,13.69,13.112,
etc.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2) Complete the following file: inversion_parameter.COMM

Column 1 = parameters of interest:
k= intrinsic permeability
n= porosity
l= heat capacity
r= medium density

Column 2 = number of zones (e.g. clay, sand...)
Column 3 and 4 (respectively min and max) = range for the value test (litterature)
Column 5 = number of tests within the previously defined range
Column 5 will be responsible for the number of simulations that will be launched.

-----------------------------------
example for 2 zones :
k 1 0001D-15 0001D-11 0001
n 1 0.05 0.40 0001
l 1 1300D-03 8400D-03 0001
r 1 2600D+00 2600D+00  0001
k 2 0001D-15 0001D-11 0001
n 2 0.05 0.40 0001
l 2 1300D-03 8400D-03 0001
r 2 2600D+00 2600D+00  0001
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3) Complete the file : inversion.COMM

Format the inversion.COMM command file columns as following :

 $1 : point name (no space) ex: Point1
 $2 : year (two last characters YY) ex for 2014: 14 
 $3 : month (two last characters MM) ex for November: 11 
 $4 : day (two last characters DD) ex: 07 
 $5 : name temperature sensor (four first characters) ex: t502
 $6 : name pressure sensor (four first characters) ex: p502
 $7 : thickness of the studied hyporheic zone (= distance between the 2 		furthest working PT100, in meters) ex: 0.40
 $8 : time step (s) ex: 900

 $9 : nb of meshes between the river bed and the first working PT100 ex: 11 (= 11 cm with a mesh of 1 cm)
 $10 : nb of meshes between the river bed and the second working PT100 ex:21
 $11 : nb of meshes between the river bed and the third working PT100 ex:31
If there are only 3/4 PT100 working, then the $11 won't be taken into account (still type in "1" or more as it's formatted and a "0" could make affect the simulation). 2/4 PT100 working the $10 won't be taken into account etc.

 $12 : nb of observations (= nb of working PT100 -1; as the deepest working PT100 is used as a boundary condition. The upper boundary condition is the temperature sensor in the stream, in the pressure differential file) ex: 3 if the 4 PT100 work, 2 if one is broken, etc.
 $13 : number of zones (clay, sand...). More than 2 would require more PT100 so it wouldn't make a lot of sense here)
 $14 : thickness of the upper zone (= distance between the riverbed and the bottom of the upper zone, in meters). Type in "0" if there is just 1 zone.

------------------------------------
example with every PT100 working and 2 zones :
Point1 14 11 07 t502 p504 0.40 900 11 21 31 3 2 0.20
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4) Complete the file : inversion_PT100.COMM

Each line contains the space between two following working PT100
The first line is the space between the riverbed and the first working PT100, the second between the first working PT100 and the second working PT100, etc.

------------------------------------
example for 4 PT100 with a space of 10 cm each:
10
10
10
10
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5) Launch the screening of multiple experiments of temperature and pressure in the HZ with the awk script inversion.awk from the terminal:
> awk -f inversion.awk inversion.COMM
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6) The simulated results per mesh are in mini-LOMOS/GINETTE_SENSI/OUTPUT/ and a comparative table of simulated versus observed is generated in mini-LOMOS/SENSI/ by "Comparaison_mailles_sim-obs.R". It is named "Results_Stats_sim-obs".
Don't forget to copy/paste it in a specific repository if you want to keep track of these files, as launching another simulation will overwrite them.
